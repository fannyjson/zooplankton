Welcome! This is the GitHub page for my master project "Using metabarcoding data to elucidate spatiotemporal distribution
patterns of zooplankton in the Baltic Sea area", where I explore metabarcoding data (years 2015-2020). 
The project was conducted at SciLifeLab in The Environmental Genomics group.  

The different pipelines should be run in the following order:

1. read_merged_18S

2. PR2: reads_comparisons_18S_metazoa 
   SILVA: reads_comparisons_18S_metazoa_SILVA

3. count_table_zooplankton

4. common_samples

5. comparison_of_methods

All the best, 
Fanny Johansson
